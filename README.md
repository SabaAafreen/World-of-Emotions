# World-of-Emotions

This was a group project I collaborated on in a Digital Media course in university (DATT 1939 Making Interactive New Media Art). This project is a website created using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The graphics are created using Illustrator and Photoshop. The music was created using iPhone's GarageBand. Our website was intended to explore three main types of emotions (happy, sad, angry) through the idea of playfulness. Our idea was to have a few games/activities to feel a certain emotion, reflect on their current emotion, or perhaps to reduce an unwanted emotion. Our website was created not to represent a traditional website but rather a playful and immersive experience in website-form. You can find our artist's statement on the website itself to find out more about our ideation process and other details. There you'll also find the sitemap of our website to understand how each page is linked to each other and the architecture of our website pages. 

Please also **NOTE**: One of our requirements in the class was to create a website for a 1350x800 window screen. In this repository you will find a file called "PinkTemplate.png", please use that to resize your browser. 

Hope you have fun navigating through our _World of Emotions_!
